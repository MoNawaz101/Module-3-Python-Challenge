# Folders:
#
#       PyBank
#               File:   main.py
#                           This file contains the python code to analyse the data set. 
#                           The code loads the csv file.
#                           It then splits the data into two lists, one for month and the other for profit/loss
#                           It then loops through the lists to:
#                               o find the number of months present in the data set
#                               o calculate the total net amount of profit/losses over the period
#                               o the changes in profit/losses over the entire period
#                               o the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#                               o the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#                           The analysis is then written to the terminal and also a datafile 
#
#       PyBank/Resources
#              File:    budget_data.csv
#                           This file contains two columns of data -  Date(month and year) and the profit/loss in that month
#
#       PyBank/Analysis
#               File:   PyBank.txt  
#                           This is the text file into which the analysis is exported
#
