# PyPoll
#--------------------------------------------

# Purpose:
#   To count the votes cast in an election for a small rural town 

# Folders:
#
#       PyPoll
#               File:   main.py
#                           This file contains the python code to analyse the data set. 
#                           The code loads the csv file.
#                           It then creates a default data dictionary (VoteCount) which contains the unique candidate name and the number of votes cast for each candidate.
#                           It splits the data dictory into 2 lists which contain the Candidates names and the number of votes they recieved. 
#                           It then uses the data to:
#                               o find the total number of votes cast.
#                               o find the candidates names, the percentage and total number of votes they recieved.
#                               o find the winner of the contest.
#                           The analysis is then written to the terminal and also a datafile.
